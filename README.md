# React Burger
<p>This is a ReactJS project that uses Firebase as a dummy backend. <p/>
<p>You can build a burger by adding certain ingredients and then see the corresponding price. You can place an order for this burger by clicking the 'Order Now' button, but you have to be logged in to be able to do so. Just make a dummy account if you want or use the email 'test@test.com' and password '777777'. After you have placed the order you can check it in the 'Orders' tab.</p> <p> Heres the working demo : https://react-my-burger-aa110.web.app </p>
